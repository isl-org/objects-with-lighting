# Capture Protocol

1. Capture an environment map with Theta Z1 from the center of the marker board.
   Use the mode for capturing multiple images with the following settings:
   ```
   f/2.1 ss 1/25000  ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 1/16000  ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 1/4000   ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 1/1000   ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 1/250    ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 1/60     ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 1/15     ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 1/4      ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 1        ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 4        ISO 80 WB 5000K
   f/2.1 ss 8        ISO 80 WB 5000K
   ```
   Capture JPEG+DNG
   TRY NOT TO BE IN THE SHOT. 
   THE OBJECT SHOULD NOT BE IN THE SHOT TOO!
   The camera takes about 40 seconds to take all images.
   If shooting outside and the sun is directly visible use the ND-filter to capture additional exposures.

2. Place object in the center of the marker board and take photos sampling a hemisphere.
   Use the following settings for the EOS90D.
   - ISO speed should be 100, 500, 1000 or 2000 depending on the lighting.
   - f-number should be 8.0
   - Exposure time can be adapted to the scene. 

3. Record about 3 exposure brackets with the tripod for testing with the EOS90D.
   Mark the tripod position on the ground and leave the camera and tripod in the last position.
   Use the timer to capture the exposure brackets and hide or do not influence the lighting.

4. Remove the object and place the Theta Z1 again in the center of the marker board.
   Capture the environment again as described in step 1 but with the camera and tripod in the image for all camera positions in step 3.
   Hide or do not influence the lighting while taking the images.
   Try not to pick up the Theta Z1 between shots. It is best to use the phone app to trigger the capture.
